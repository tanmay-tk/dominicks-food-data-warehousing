# dominicks-food-data-warehousing

The objective of this project is to design and develop a data warehouse for a retail store chain called Dominick’s Fine Food (DFF) that has many branches.  We use their store level data to set up the data warehouse and help them analyze the data.


**Personal Contributions and Learnings:**

Deployed a data warehouse solution using agile methodology and tools like Microsoft SQL Server and SSIS, focusing on ETL processes and designing star schema and staging tables 

Used Dimensional Modeling technique and Kimball's methodology to create the star schemas.

Designed a Mapping table#1 from SOURCE FILES TO STAGING TABLES that includes and Mapping table#2 from STAGING TABLES TO PRESENTATION SERVER TALBES

Develop a brief physical design plan by describing data aggregate plan, indexing plan, data standardization plan, and storage plan 

Developed ETL Plan
 Defigning all the target data needed in the data warehouse.
 Prepare and write data mappings in Excel for data elements from sources to staging and then data mapping from staging to data warehouse,
 Write all comprehensive data extraction rules.
 Write all data transformation and cleansing rules.
 Write a plan for aggregate tables.
 Write out the organization of data staging area.
 Write procedures for all data extractions and loadings.

Implementation of the ETL Plan
 Performed necessary cleansing, summarizations and other transformations as needed in the staging database.
 Reviewed the data granularity needed at the independent data mart level. 
 Load the data into independent data marts

Devised actionable insights by developing of a set of BI reports using combinations of Power BI, SSAS and SSRS for the end users of DFF stores.
